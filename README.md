# Amherst Eats

Amherst Eats is a project aimed at enhancing the dining experience for students near the University of Massachusetts (UMass). As students ourselves, we understand the challenges of deciding where to eat, whether it's opting for the dining hall, visiting a familiar restaurant, or exploring new culinary options. With an abundance of eateries in the area, it can be overwhelming to choose the next dining destination. Our project addresses this by providing a centralized platform that includes a curated database of local restaurants, an interactive Food Mood Quiz to help users discover new culinary experiences based on their preferences and mood, and an interactive map for visualizing nearby dining venues. Through these features, Amherst Eats aims to transform the process of selecting a dining venue into an enjoyable and stress-free activity for students.
